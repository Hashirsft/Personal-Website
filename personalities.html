                <p>Allama Muhammad Iqbal, born on November 9, 1877, in Sialkot, was a distinguished philosopher, poet, and politician whose ideas significantly shaped the intellectual and cultural revival of the Muslim world in the early 20th century. Known as the "Poet of the East" and a principal figure in the conceptualization of Pakistan, Iqbal's profound poetry in Persian and Urdu, including works like "Asrar-e-Khudi" (Secrets of the Self), emphasized self-realization and spiritual awakening. His philosophical vision, articulated in the 1930 Allahabad Address, called for an independent Muslim state, laying the groundwork for Pakistan's creation in 1947. Celebrated for his enduring impact on Islamic thought and South Asian politics, Iqbal's legacy continues to inspire, with his birthday commemorated as Iqbal Day in Pakistan.</p>

                <p>Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, born on December 25, 1876, in Karachi, is the founding father of Pakistan and one of the most influential leaders in South Asian history. As a brilliant lawyer and charismatic leader, Jinnah played a pivotal role in the creation of Pakistan, advocating for the rights of Muslims in British India. Initially a member of the Indian National Congress, he later joined the All-India Muslim League, becoming its leader and championing the two-nation theory, which called for separate states for Muslims and Hindus. His unwavering leadership and negotiation skills culminated in the partition of India and the establishment of Pakistan on August 14, 1947. Jinnah served as Pakistan's first Governor-General until his death on September 11, 1948. Revered as "Quaid-e-Azam" (Great Leader), his vision and principles continue to guide Pakistan's national identity and political landscape.</p>

                <h3 class="mg-btm-sm1">Abdul Sattar Edhi</h3>
                <p>Abdul Sattar Edhi, born on February 28, 1928, in Bantva, British India (now in Gujarat, India), was a renowned Pakistani philanthropist, social worker, and humanitarian who founded the Edhi Foundation, the largest and most respected welfare organization in Pakistan. Known for his unwavering commitment to helping the needy, Edhi began his humanitarian work in Karachi in 1951 with a small medical dispensary. Over the years, the Edhi Foundation expanded to include a vast network of ambulances, orphanages, shelters, clinics, and rehabilitation centers, providing essential services to millions of people regardless of their race, religion, or ethnicity. Edhi lived a modest life, dedicating himself entirely to his mission of serving humanity. His selflessness and compassion earned him numerous national and international awards and accolades, including the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Public Service. Abdul Sattar Edhi passed away on July 8, 2016, but his legacy lives on, inspiring countless others to follow in his footsteps of humanitarian service and kindness.</p>
